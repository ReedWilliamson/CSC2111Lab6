# CSC2111Lab6

I got it to mostly compile with no errors. But I keep getting one error saying 
"undefined reference to 'WinMain@16'"

Not completely sure what that is about. 

I'll probably work on it some more tomorrow too, but if you can figure it out awesome, 
if not, then we can find a time to meet up. Email me at drwilliams42@students.tntech.edu
